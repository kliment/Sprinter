#####################
# BUILD REQUIREMENTS
#####################

These instructions only apply if you are required to build the code
from source.  If you are not required to do this, fetch the compiled
binaries and follow their instructions.

This is not an instructional document on how to use github, avr
utilities, or other development packages.  If you do not know how to
use these, find a local friend and ask for their assistance.

On all platforms the build is similar:
- verify that Arduino 1.0.1 or later is installed and generates
  code for your specific Arduino.
- get a copy of the Sprinter code.  Since we are building from source, 
  you should branch kliment/Sprinter and clone that code.

The currently supported platforms are
OSX 10.6.8  TODO
OSX 10.7    TODO
Win7/32     TODO
Win7/64     TODO
Win8        TODO
Ubuntu12    TODO

#BUILD STEPS FLASH
##################

1) Launch arduino-1.0.1, set the board and port, verify that it can
   see your RAMPS controller.

2) Open the Sprinter.pde or Sprinter.ino file.  Arduino-1.0.1 suports
   the old format, the name will change now or in the future.

3) Verify (compile) the Sprinter sketch.  If it does not compile
   completely,  exit these instructions and resolve the problem[
   This could be as simple as changing a variable in Sprinter.pde or
   as complex as installing new/different Arduino software.

4) Upload the sketch to the board.  As of 1.0.1, Arduino still
   re-compiles everything before an upload, this is a bug in Arduino
   not in Sprinter software.

5) If "Done uploading." appears in the dialog box
       reset the RAMPS unit
   If anything else appears, correct the problem and retry this step

6) Open the Serial Port Monitor and verify the port and bps rate of
   your connection.  This should trigger a RAMPS reset and you should
   see the software announcement in the Serial Monitor.

7) Restart the RAMPS controller by pushing the resset pin.  After the
   reset, the Serial Monitor should update.

8) At this point the installation should be considered complete.
   Exit Arduino

#BUILD STEPS CLIENT
###################

No client software is included in Sprinter.  An open-source client
designed to work with RAMPS will be your best test subject.  I test
with pronterface, but am happy to test with other clients if
pronterface works and they don't.
